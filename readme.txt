  1.1 What is it?
  ----------------
  
   VertrigoServ was developed to make available a highly professional 
   and easily installable package of Apache, PHP5, MySQL and PhpMyAdmin 
   for Windows platform. With a convenient all-in-one installer, all components 
   are installed in a single directory and can be used immediately after 
   the installation process has completed. An uninstaller allows you to 
   remove the VertrigoServ from hard disc.

  VertrigoServ runs on most Windows NT-type Windows-32 systems, such as
  Windows 2000, Windows XP or Windows 2003.

  1.5 Support
  ------------

  1.6 Firewalls
  ------------
  
  Some firewall software may silently block VertrigoServ from running. 
  Most firewalls will ask you whether to allow a program to connect to the Internet. 
  It's important that you always grant VertrigoServ access. 
  If you deny access, you must go into the firewall's configuration program and re-allow access. 
  Even when disabled, some firewalls deny access.
  
  2.1 Installing
  --------------
  
  Having accepted the license terms, you can choose a directory to install the
  software to. You should keep the suggested default directory unless you have a
  good reason for choosing another directory.
  Click Install to begin the installation. You will see some windows popping up 
  and closing again. This is normal as the VertrigoServ installer sets up the 
  various software components.
  
  2.2 Unistalling
  ---------------
  
  To uninstall VertrigoServ, open the Control Panel and start the
  Add/Remove Programs applet. You will see a list of all software 
  currently installed on your computer. Click the Change/Remove 
  button of the VertrigoServ entry and confirm the uninstallation.

  in "VertrigoServ Backup Files" folder (which is in your default documents folder).
